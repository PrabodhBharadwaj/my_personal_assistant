1. tl;dr
Building a personal AI assistant to help me capture, organize, and act on life's inputs effortlessly.
Starting with the absolute essentials that I need daily, then expanding based on what actually works for
my workflow.
True MVP Focus (Phase 1 - 4 weeks):
Universal capture (text + voice)
Basic task storage with simple retrieval
One AI feature: Daily planning assistant
Phase 2 (if Phase 1 works - 3 weeks):
Contextual recommendations
Basic semantic search
This is a personal-first approach that can scale to others later if successf
ul.

10. Risk Mitigation
Technical Risks
Risk: AI-assisted coding fails, can't implement features
Likelihood: Medium Impact: High Mitigation:
Start with simplest possible examples
Use multiple AI tools (ChatGPT + Claude) for different perspectives
Focus on copying/modifying working code vs. building from scratch
Have fallback: hire developer for 1-2 sessions if completely stuck
Risk: OpenAI API costs spiral out of control
Likelihood: Low Impact: Medium Mitigation:
Set strict usage limits in OpenAI dashboard ($10/month max)
Use cheaper models (gpt-4o-mini) for most requests
Implement client-side rate limiting
Monitor costs weekly, not monthly
Risk: Data loss with localStorage approach
Likelihood: Medium Impact: High Mitigation:
Build export feature in Week 2 (before lots of data)
Regular manual backups to cloud storage
Clear migration path to Supabase when ready
Risk: Browser compatibility issues
Likelihood: Medium Impact: Medium Mitigation:
Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox from Week 1
Use standard APIs, avoid cutting-edge features
Gracef
ul degradation for unsupported features
Product Risks
Risk: Feature creep returns, scope expands beyond MVP
Likelihood: High Impact: Medium Mitigation:
Strict "Phase 1 only" rule for first month
Write down Phase 2+ ideas instead of
building
Weekly scope review: "Is this truly necessary for daily use?"
Risk: Perfectionism prevents shipping
Likelihood: Medium Impact: High Mitigation:
"Good enough for personal use" quality standard
Ship every Friday, even if
buggy
Focus on working over polished
Risk: Lose interest before completion
Likelihood: Medium Impact: High Mitigation:
Focus on features I'll use immediately
Keep scope tiny and achievable
Celebrate small wins weekly
Personal/Learning Risks
Risk: Over-engineering for hypothetical f
uture scale
Likelihood: Medium Impact: Medium Mitigation:
Build explicitly for N=1 (myself)
Resist suggestions for "proper" architecture
Optimize for learning and iteration speed
Risk: Get stuck on technical problems for days
Likelihood: Medium Impact: Medium Mitigation:
Time-box problem solving (2 hours max before asking for help)
Use AI tools for debugging and explanation
Accept imperfect solutions that work

Conclusion
This PRD represents a disciplined approach to building a personal AI assistant that prioritizes learning,
utility, and realistic scope. The key insight is building for N=1 first, then scaling only if successf
ul.
The success of this project will be measured not by features built, but by whether it genuinely
improves daily productivity and becomes a natural part of my workflow. Everything else is secondary.
Next Action: Begin Week 1 development with first AI coding session to create basic capture interface.
